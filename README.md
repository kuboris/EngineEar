# EngineEar
We distilled years of experience of mechanical engineers into a simple and easy to act upon solution. With neural networks analyzing how your car sounds and what diagnostic codes it is sending, we can tell when and what is about to break. Then we provide you with the best options to address any discovered problem.

We listen to your care engine even if no one else does! In combination with data about vin type, present error type and rpm we can predict failure between it changes to something major…. Or let you identify the exact source of your problems.
And used TensorFlow to teach it to classify “failing drive belt” in a motor sound. App extracts a sound features then analyzes them. Server classifies the sound features and respods with type of engine failure and confidence of how much is it sure that it’s that kind of mistakes.

Because you can send a precise car diagnostics directly to our platform repair shops will have all the information they need to fixit and bid on the repair price.
No more Scams or Half-Assed jobs !
